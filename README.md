# Project-4-AI-Blackjack

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and analyze optimized strategies for playing Blackjack using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use Keras to build a model using the Actor Critic Method that predicts the best possible moves based on the player's current hand, the dealer's upcard, and the game state. This model will help evaluate and improve the performance of Blackjack strategies and generate recommendations that enhance the player's chances of winning.

While traditional Blackjack strategies are based on basic probability and simple rules for actions like hitting, standing, doubling down, and splitting, a more in-depth analysis using machine learning can improve these strategies by factoring in variables like dealer tendencies, specific betting patterns, and even card counting. For the scope of this project, the model will recommend to either "Hit" or "Stay" depending on the players' cards and the dealers upcard.
